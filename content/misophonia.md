# Misophonia

If you are reading this, chances are that I sent you here because a noise you made has triggered a condition I have called _misophonia_.

First and foremost, I completely recognize that this is an issue **with me** and not you.
This is in no way a condemnation or an insult, but a request for help.

Nonetheless, the only good solution that I have is to politely ask you to avoid making the noise.

## What is misophonia?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia):

> Misophonia, meaning "hatred of sound", is a proposed neurological condition in which certain sounds trigger emotional or physiological responses others may deem unreasonable... Common triggers include oral sounds (e.g., loud breathing, chewing, swallowing), clicking sounds (e.g., keyboard tapping, finger tapping, windshield wipers), and sounds associated with movement (e.g., fidgeting).

Everybody with this condition experiences it differently and it likely has a genetic link.

## How it affects me

My main triggers are largely mouth-based sounds.
Usually chewing of some form.
Some people's chewing triggers me more than others'.

My condition is better or worse at different times.
What is triggering me now may trigger me more or less later.

Not all sounds bother me the same amount and there are a few conditions that worsen the effect for me:

- Mood
- Exhaustion
- Stress and/or anxiety
- Any other mental or emotional distress
- A close relationship with the person

The latter one is particularly hard to describe.
Basically, the better relationship I have with someone, the more that a trigger sound they make upsets me.

If it helps, take this as a sign that I like and trust you.

## How I deal with misophonia

In the majority of cases, I can just silently work through it.
For example, I have found that it is not worth explaining if the scenario is clearly short-lived; especially if the trigger sound isn't particularly bad.

However, if the sound is repeated or is clearly bound to keep repeating, I only have a few options at my disposal.

The main one is to just remove myself from the situation (AKA flight).
Sometimes, this happens without my choosing.
I will just quickly leave in a panic without any explanation.

Another option is also uncontrollable and that is the "fight" response.
While I have never hit **anybody**, there have been a couple of occasions where that was a struggle.
More often, I feel the need to claw at my own skin or just greatly tense up.
The best way I can explain this feeling is to have you imagine nails on a chalkboard.

The final option is to discuss it with you in order to try and remove the trigger.
Hence my sending you here.

I have had a few traumatic experiences where explaining this condition to people has led to them taunting me with it, so it takes a bit of trust and vulnerability on my part in order to even send this to you.

Because of this, I _am_ cautious in who I bring it up with.
However, I am not embarassed by it and have no issues discussing it with you freely and openly.

I hope that your making it this far means you are willing to understand my situation.
