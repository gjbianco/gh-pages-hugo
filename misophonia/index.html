This is in no way a condemnation or an insult, but a request for help.</p><p>Nonetheless, the only good solution that I have is to politely ask you to avoid making the noise.</p><h2 id=what-is-misophonia>What is misophonia?</h2><p>From <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia>Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Misophonia, meaning &ldquo;hatred of sound&rdquo;, is a proposed neurological condition in which certain sounds trigger emotional or physiological responses others may deem unreasonable&mldr; Common triggers include oral sounds (e.g., loud breathing, chewing, swallowing), clicking sounds (e.g., keyboard tapping, finger tapping, windshield wipers), and sounds associated with movement (e.g., fidgeting).</p></blockquote><p>Everybody with this condition experiences it differently and it likely has a genetic link.</p><h2 id=how-it-affects-me>How it affects me</h2><p>My main triggers are largely mouth-based sounds.
Usually chewing of some form.
Some people&rsquo;s chewing triggers me more than others'.</p><p>My condition is better or worse at different times.
What is triggering me now may trigger me more or less later.</p><p>Not all sounds bother me the same amount and there are a few conditions that worsen the effect for me:</p><ul><li>Mood</li><li>Exhaustion</li><li>Stress and/or anxiety</li><li>Any other mental or emotional distress</li><li>A close relationship with the person</li></ul><p>The latter one is particularly hard to describe.
Basically, the better relationship I have with someone, the more that a trigger sound they make upsets me.</p><p>If it helps, take this as a sign that I like and trust you.</p><h2 id=how-i-deal-with-misophonia>How I deal with misophonia</h2><p>In the majority of cases, I can just silently work through it.
For example, I have found that it is not worth explaining if the scenario is clearly short-lived; especially if the trigger sound isn&rsquo;t particularly bad.</p><p>However, if the sound is repeated or is clearly bound to keep repeating, I only have a few options at my disposal.</p><p>The main one is to just remove myself from the situation (AKA flight).
Sometimes, this happens without my choosing.
I will just quickly leave in a panic without any explanation.</p><p>Another option is also uncontrollable and that is the &ldquo;fight&rdquo; response.
While I have never hit <strong>anybody</strong>, there have been a couple of occasions where that was a struggle.
More often, I feel the need to claw at my own skin or just greatly tense up.
The best way I can explain this feeling is to have you imagine nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>The final option is to discuss it with you in order to try and remove the trigger.
Hence my sending you here.</p><p>I have had a few traumatic experiences where explaining this condition to people has led to them taunting me with it, so it takes a bit of trust and vulnerability on my part in order to even send this to you.</p><p>Because of this, I <em>am</em> cautious in who I bring it up with.
However, I am not embarassed by it and have no issues discussing it with you freely and openly.</p><p>I hope that your making it this far means you are willing to understand my situation.</p></article></section></div></main><script src=/js/dark-mode.min.0213e1773e6d1c5a644f847c67a6f8abac49a3776e2976f6008038af8c5b76a1.js></script></body></html>
