The more consistent you are, the less lessons the user has to learn and keep in their head (cognitive load) while using your interface.</p><p>That being said, do not overload the user. Too much at once or too much &ldquo;cognitive load&rdquo; causes the user to become confused, annoyed, and stressed. You want your user to <em>enjoy</em> using your interface, not loathe it.</p><p>Each screen or view should have a distinct purpose. The general test is if you can&rsquo;t sum up what the screen does in one or two words (e.g. &ldquo;user management&rdquo;), then it likely needs to be broken up.</p><p>Do not fall victim to the trap of counting &ldquo;number of clicks&rdquo;. In general, less clicks is better, but clear organization and easy understanding (i.e. &ldquo;intuitiveness&rdquo;) is far more important and often requires more clicks.</p><h2 id=dont-be-afraid-of-whitespace>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of whitespace!</h2><p>A good UI uses whitespace effectively to emphasize or to organize.</p><p>Think of how you might arrange a shelf. A little bit of a gap between boxes or books goes a long way to show the imaginary compartments you&rsquo;ve created on the shelf.</p><p>Something that looks sparse to the original developer can still look information dense and cluttered to a user &ndash; especially their first time using it.</p><p>The more things you have on screen (this even includes things like borders or background images), the more cluttered your interface looks and the more cognitive load it creates.</p><p>Everything about your interface should be communicating <em>something</em> relevant to the user (even if it is communicating something more abstract like how the interface is organized).</p><h2 id=color-usage>Color usage</h2><p>Colors should not be the only way to obtain a piece of information (colorblindness is very common), but should still be used to augment the user&rsquo;s experience.</p><p>For example, you should have a primary color to draw the user&rsquo;s attention to the &ldquo;happy path&rdquo; (see CTAs) button. You&rsquo;ll use more warm colors to indicate &ldquo;danger&rdquo; or a negative response (e.g. green means affrimative, red means negative).</p><h2 id=calls-to-action-cta>Calls to Action (CTA)</h2><p>Primary actions (AKA &ldquo;calls to action&rdquo; or CTA) should be at the very far left or right (which one is down to style, just be consistent). Again, this is to draw the user to them quickly.</p><p>For example, if the user can cancel or submit a form, then the submit button is (likely) the CTA and should be on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; (far left or far right) of the form.</p><h2 id=tables>Tables</h2><p>Tables are a great way to organize <em>tabular data</em>.</p><p>Only include columns that are immediately relevant to the task at hand (tables can almost be thought of as &ldquo;sub screens&rdquo;).</p><p>One view should only have one or two tables visible at the same time, <em>at most</em>.</p><p>Tables are extremely information dense &ndash; use this to your advantage but be cautious.</p><h1 id=general-code-guidelines>General code guidelines</h1><p>Code is a form of interface where the computer is obviously part of your audience, but so are other developers. Both are equally important.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to make a computer understand your code, it&rsquo;s even harder to make a human understand it.</p><h2 id=no-inline-style-tags>No inline style tags</h2><p>For example, <code>&lt;h2 style="color: white;"></code>)</p><p>If HTML is the model, CSS is the view, and JS is the controller. Don&rsquo;t mix them.</p><p>Styles should be contained within their own files to promote better organization and easier maintenance.</p><p>Prefer library styles over custom styles. You wouldn&rsquo;t recreate a sort function if you already include a library function that does it.</p><p>If you have to write a custom style, use class attributes.</p><h2 id=no-checked-in-commented-code>No checked in commented code</h2><p>Git keeps a full history, so unless there are <em>immediate</em> plans to uncomment, there&rsquo;s no reason to keep unused code around cluttering it up.</p><p>Make reusable components/files &ndash; Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</p><p>Unless it is substantially more code to do so, code (especially HTML) should not be repeated. This allows for easier maintenance and less copy/paste related bugs. Think of components like functions.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
