It came up after a humorous post that complained about a particular tool (I won&rsquo;t say which) being overly complex.
Not just complex, but the author claimed it was <em>maliciously</em> and <em>intentionally</em> designed to be complex as a form of gatekeeping.</p><p>It seemed as though this person ran into the same pitfall as a lot of developers: being expected to quickly learn an unexpectedly complex tool.</p><p>On the one hand, this particular case felt silly and over-the-top because it appeared they didn&rsquo;t take the time to learn the tool.
On the other hand, it <em>is</em> a very unintuitive tool.</p><p>Without giving away too much, the main point is that the tool doesn&rsquo;t just solve a single problem; it solves numerous categories of problems and does so relatively elegantly.
Unfortunately, using it for the simplest cases still inherits the necessary complexity for the more advanced use cases.</p><p>Beyond that, this tool is taught as though it is &ldquo;easy to learn, difficult to master&rdquo;.
In reality, the difficulty curve is shaped like a reverse &ldquo;L&rdquo;.
Because many are not warned of that difficulty upfront (or they choose to ignore it), they don&rsquo;t see the difficulty <em>cliff</em> until after they&rsquo;ve been burned.</p><p>Even if this tool were taught better (and I&rsquo;m <em>personally</em> trying to improve just that), this tool is not exceptional in its unintuitiveness.
Dealing with complexity is part of the nature of software development.</p><p>I want to claim that, while it has <em>immense</em> value, intuitiveness (or lack thereof) is not the <em>only</em> design goal or decision for&mldr; anything.
Some tools <em>are</em> <strong>needlessly</strong> complex, while others are <strong>needfully</strong> so.
For a given tool, which is the case is both relative and subjective, and highly dependent on <em>your</em> use-cases (&ldquo;right tool for the job&rdquo;).</p><p>Alternatively, it <em>would</em> be gatekeeping or elitist to say &ldquo;I like this tool&rsquo;s complexity because it weeds out Bad Developers&rdquo;.
That statement is inherently biased to believe that only one type of developer should exist; all others should disappear.
Extending that to assume all complex tools are inherently elitist or malicious is fallacious.</p><p>When it comes down to it, learning and understanding complex tools, languages, and interfaces is not gatekeeping, it is part of the job description.</p><p>To sum up:</p><ul><li>Yes, tools should be made more intuitive where reasonable.</li><li>Yes, some tools are <strong>needlessly</strong> unintuitive.</li><li>Yes, there is a <em>lot</em> of gatekeeping and elitism in software development.</li><li>No, these are not all the same thing.</li></ul></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
