Kinda like non-awful inverse iframes.
Each application provided its own UI, which would include/import a big navigation web component that had its own lifecycle. The boundary was kept relatively clean since a web component can only communicate with its parent via element attributes.
Basically, we designed it where the parent controlled the state of the navigation by putting a couple of JSON blobs on specific attributes.</description></item></channel></rss>
